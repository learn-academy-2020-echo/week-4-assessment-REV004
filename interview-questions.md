# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Are Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

Your answer: theyre mutators

Researched answer:

2. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: is a group of statements that are called with a defined function method

Researched answer:A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: that its not called since ruby is a last order function

Researched answer: when return isnâ€™t explicitly called within a method then Ruby returns the value of the last executed instruction in the method

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:object is defined to a specific set of data given to a variable and functional programming is the same and doesnt change.

Researched answer:
functional programming :
Functional programming is the form of programming that attempts to avoid changing state and mutable data. In a functional program, the output of a function should always be the same, given the same exact inputs to the function. This is because the outputs of a function in functional programming purely relies on arguments of the function, and there is no magic that is happening behind the scenes. This is called eliminating side effects in your code.
OOP:Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which you program using objects to represent things you are programming about (sometimes real world things). These objects could be data structures. The objects hold data about them in attributes. The attributes in the objects are manipulated through methods or functions that are given to the object.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: a class is a set of information that describe an object and when called it pulls out that information that is stored and an object is defined

Researched answer:
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your vehicle is an instance of the class of objects known as vehicle. A vehicle can also have certain functions, such as halting, driving, and speeding. Even these functions form the data members of the class Vehicle. You can, therefore, define a class as a combination of characteristics and functions.
an object is a set of information given to one defined object.

6. STRETCH: What is Duck Typing?

Your answer: where a duck runs your program

Researched answer: Duck typing means that an operation does not formally specify the requirements that its operands have to meet, but just tries it out with what is given.
